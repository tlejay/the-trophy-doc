## 5. Key Differentiators for C-REWARDS

### 5.1 Mission-Based Engagement (vs. Spend-Based)

The1 is a **passive** loyalty program – users earn points simply by spending money. C-REWARDS is **active** – users complete missions (check-in at locations, attend events, share content) to earn points. This creates deeper engagement and emotional connection.

**Implication:** C-REWARDS can drive foot traffic and engagement even outside of purchase events (e.g., stadium visits, training ground experiences).

### 5.2 Exclusive, Money-Can't-Buy Experiences

While The1 focuses on discounts and cash equivalents, C-REWARDS unlocks **unique experiences** such as:
- Access to closed-door training sessions
- VIP seating upgrades
- Meet-and-greet with players/staff
- Priority parking at events

These create perceived value far exceeding the point cost.

### 5.3 White-Label Flexibility

The1 is tightly coupled to Central Group branding. C-REWARDS is **brand-neutral** and can be deployed for multiple sports clubs, membership organizations, or businesses without conflict.

### 5.4 Precision Location Technology

C-REWARDS uses **KML/Polygon-based geofencing** rather than simple radius checks. This allows accurate check-in validation at complex venues (e.g., specific stadium zones, partner store locations) and prevents fraud.

## 6. Insights for Proposal Presentation

1. **Position C-REWARDS as a Next-Generation Platform:** Move beyond transactional loyalty (The1) to experiential engagement.

2. **Highlight Data Ownership:** Unlike The1 (where Central Group owns the data), C-REWARDS gives the client full ownership of member data and analytics.

3. **Emphasize Fraud Prevention:** The1 faces limited fraud risk (transaction-based). C-REWARDS' location-based missions require robust anti-gaming measures – a key technical differentiator.

4. **Demonstrate Flexibility:** Show how C-REWARDS' configurable earn/burn rates and tiering can be tailored to the client's specific goals, unlike The1's fixed structure.
