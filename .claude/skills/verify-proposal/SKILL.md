# /verify - Proposal Documents Verification

Verify consistency across all proposal documents in the Deliverables folder.

## Files to Verify

Read and compare these 5 files:
1. `Deliverables/Proposal-Executive-TH.md` (Thai Executive Summary)
2. `Deliverables/Proposal-Executive.md` (English Executive Summary)
3. `Deliverables/Proposal-TH.md` (Thai Full Proposal)
4. `Deliverables/Proposal.md` (English Full Proposal)
5. `Deliverables/Presentation-TH.md` (Thai Presentation)

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Content Consistency
- Project name and description
- Key features and functionalities
- Technology stack
- Team composition
- Contact information
- Recommendations (features to include/exclude)

### 2. Phase Alignment
- Number of phases (should be 3: POC, MVP, Full-Scale)
- Phase names and descriptions
- Deliverables per phase
- Success criteria per phase

### 3. Budget Matching
- Phase 1 (POC) budget
- Phase 2 (MVP) budget
- Phase 3 (Full-Scale) budget
- Total development cost
- Annual operational costs
- 3-year total investment
- Payment terms per phase
- Support plan pricing (Basic/Professional/Enterprise)

## Running Number Logic

1. Check existing files in `Deliverables/Verification-Report/`
2. Find the highest existing number (e.g., Verification-003.md)
3. Increment by 1 for the new report (e.g., 004)
4. Use 3-digit zero-padded format (001, 002, 003, etc.)

## Output Format

Generate report at: `Deliverables/Verification-Report/Verification-<NNN>.md`

### Report Structure

Use this exact markdown structure:

# Verification Report #<NNN>
## The Trophy (C Rewards)

**Date:** <current date in Thai Buddhist Era>
**Verified By:** AI Agent (Claude)
